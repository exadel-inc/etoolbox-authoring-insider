## EToolbox Authoring Insider - Usage

Create or open a webpage in AEM in edit mode. Then, open a component's dialog that contains text fields or RTEs. You will most probably notice a ![Insider button](img/insider-button.png) button. Click it, and you will receive a dropdown of tools that are available for the current field.

![Dropdown](img/dropdown.png)

Small buttons beside each tool in the picture manifest the providers that are available for the current tool. (There are no provider icons if a provider is not required, or else there's only one, or, on the contrary, there are too many to display.) If a user simply clicks the menu item, the default provider is used. If a user clicks a provider icon, the tool is executed with this provider.

After clicking on a tool, a chat dialog usually opens.

The chat dialog features both the user's input and the responses by _Insider_. As a rule, under the last _Insider_'s response, there are "quick reactions" buttons. A user can request another variant, or type in an own command or clarification, etc. The blue "checkmark" button is to accept the last response. (If responses are many, a separate checkmark button pops up beside each of them.)

From the dialog's header, a user can switch to another provider by selecting it in a dropdown, and also "restart" the current dialog.

Some tools are designed to have additional dialog steps. E.g., a translation tool opens a window to select the needed language before entering the chat dialog. Some other tools can do without a chat dialog since they present non-AI-based facilities.

After a response is accepted, its text is inserted into the current field. If there was a selection inside the field, the response normally replaces just the selected part.
